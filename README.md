# Azure DDNS

This is a simple bash script that can be used as a cronjob to use Azure DNS for your dynamic DNS. If you have a low traffic domain, this is much cheaper than any bespoke DDNS service. Can be run on a Raspberry Pi, Mac, or any other single computer on your network with cron and bash/zsh/sh.
